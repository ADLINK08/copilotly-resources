# Using Copilotly

So, how does Copilotly work? It’s pretty easy and straightforward. All you need to do is highlight text on any website and an icon will appear at the top of the selected text. Then, clicking on this icon will open up a widget where your selected text will be present in a text box. From here, you can select the category and copilot of your choice to generate the text.

## Step 1: Highlight Text

The first step is to highlight the text you want to generate. You can highlight any text on any website. You can also highlight multiple paragraphs of text.
